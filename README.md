# xkdb
Xinu Kernel DeBugger is a project that allows you to use GDB on remote
xinu backends.

## How to Use

Firstly, you need to find the right stub for your architecture. If you
don't know the architecture of your Xinu backend board maybe pay more
attention in your OS class :) For reference, here is a cheat sheet for Purdue's
boards in 2019.

* **Galilelo** - x86 / i386

* **Beaglebone Black** - ARM

If a stub doesn't exist for your board, please read the instructions in
[PORTING](PORTING.md).

1. **Compile appropriate stub into your xinu build**

   Move `stub/<arch>-stub.c` into `system/<arch>-stub.c`.

   Make the following change in your `system/initialize.c` file, firstly add
   these prototypes on the top of the file with the other externs:

   ```c
   extern void set_debug_traps(); // Add these two function
   extern void breakpoint();      // prototypes
   ```

   Next add these two function calls near the bottom of the `sysinit()` 
   function (changes marked with `//` comments):

```c
   static  void    sysinit()
   {
   ...
       /* Create a ready list for processes */

       readylist = newqueue();

       set_debug_traps(); // Add these two
       breakpoint();      // function calls here
        
       /* Initialize the real time clock */
    
       clkinit();
   ...
   }
```

2. **Add debug flag to your xinu Makefile**

   Open up `compile/Makefile` and find the line with the compiler flags, it
   should look like this: ```CFLAGS  = -march=i586 ...```

   Add `-g` to the `CFLAGS` variable so it looks along the lines of:
   `CFLAGS  = -g -march=i586 -m32 -fno-builtin...`
   
3. **Recompile**

   Run `make clean`, `make rebuild` and `make` in order to compile the stub
   and debug symbols into your xinu image.

4. **Use xkdb.py to connect to a backend board**

   Change into your Xinu `/compile` directory. You can then run xkdb with
   `~/path/to/xkdb/py-console/xkdb.py`
   
   This will automatically upload the xinu image file and power cycle the
   backend. Use the `--help` option view all the options available for
   `xkdb.py`
   
   >*Tip*: Add `$HOME/path/to/xkdb/py-console` to your `PATH` variable so you can
   >simply use the command `xkdb.py` instead of specifying the full path.
   
   >To do that edit your `~/.bashrc` and add the line `export PATH=${PATH}:$HOME/path/to/xkdb/py-console` .
   >If you already have this line to add another path, just add the path next to your list of path seperate by a colon `:`.
   
   >Then just run `. ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.bashrc` to update your bash profile.

5. **Connect GDB to the backend**

   Open up another terminal and run `gdb -x ~/.xkdb`

   GDB will be unresponsive until the backend is fully booted, then you should
   see the breakpoint be hit.

## Project Structure

* `stub/` - The gdb stub and changes on the Xinu side to act as
  a remote debugging target.

* `py-console/` - A Python version of the `cs-console` command,
  used to establish a connection to the Xinu backends and pipe
  data in and out through to GDB.

## Running Tests

`cd py-console`

`python -m pytest`

## How does it work?

This project leverages the ability of GDB to debug remote targets using a thin
text protocol. The primary purpose of this protocol is to allow the use of GDB 
on systems where compiling the full debugger is too difficult. A remote host
can then drive the debugging session by sending simple commands to the small
gdb server. 

By equipping a board running Xinu with the GDB stub, we allow a remote host 
running GDB to debug it. The main problems this project solves are:

1. Getting the GDB stub to compile on the Xinu source tree.

2. Augmenting the `cs-console` command to patch through the GDB protocol 
   to a local instance of GDB.

The final architecture to allow remote debugging then looks like: 

```
+---------+         +------------+
| Galileo | Serial  |    Xinu    |
|  Board  <--------->   Server   |
|         |         |            |
+---------+         +-----^------+
                          |  Network
      +-------------------|-------+
      |  +-----+    +-----v----+  |
      |  | GDB |    |cs-console|  |
      |  |     <---->          |  |
      |  +-----+    +----------+  |
      |      Xinu Workstation     |
      +---------------------------+

```

In order to allow regular output and the GDB protocol to both be sent through
serial, we prefix each GDB message with `<STX>G` where STX is the ASCII start
of text character (`\x02`). Each message is terminated with `<EOT>` (end of
transmission `\x04`).

Our re-written version of `cs-console` does the following:

* Opens up a server socket that gdb can connect to as a target.

* Prints output as the original `cs-console` normally would but upon
  encountering `<STX>G` will stop printing and start piping the messages
  through to gdb.

* Forward any data sent by gdb through to the galileo board.

## Known Issues

1. **Caution when using GDB Plugins with this project**

If you choose to do so, expect that they may potentially cause problems that xinu doesn't like. gdb-peda (https://github.com/longld/peda) calls getpid() in the remote process when it starts up, which makes it look like xinu is crashing there. It's not :)
